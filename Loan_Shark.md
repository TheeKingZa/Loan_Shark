# Loan Shark Application Web App

```
  Welcome to our Loan Application Web App.
  Our goal is to provide a simple and transparent way for users
  to apply for loans and understand their repayment amounts.
```

# How We Work:
1. User Registration:
      Users can enter their name and the desired loan amount in the application form.

2. Instant Calculation:
      Upon form submission, our application instantly calculates the total repayment amount based on a fixed interest rate of 50% for a one-month term.

3. Transparent Display:
      The application displays the loan details, including the user's name, loan amount, and total repayment amount, providing clear and concise information.


# Loan Calculation:
- Interest Rate: Our loan calculation uses a fixed interest rate of 50% for one month.
- Total Repayment Formula:
  Total Repayment = Principal + (Principal * Interest Rate)

For example:
- If you borrow R100, you will need to repay R150 after one month.
- If you borrow R50, you will need to repay R75 after one month.

```
  Our loan calculation ensures that users have a clear understanding of the repayment amount before taking a loan, promoting financial transparency and responsibility.
